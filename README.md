Theodore's lair is a mod for Diablo 1 and Hellfire (Hellfire is recommended) that aims to increase the difficulty of the game and add more content based on the germanic folklore. We add some germanic monsters and we rename others, we add some unique item with variables and we add some new bosses.

before the horadrim used it as a temple and built the cathedral on it, the dungeon was the kingdom of the Nibelungen, a people of dwarfs. the years have passed and the dwarves have died, leaving their treasures in the hands of evil creatures, notably a dragon who has renamed Nibelung and his legion.

The Horadrim have decided to lock the soul stone of Diablo, the lord of terror there because no one can survive the monster in the dungeon. however Diablo is free and in the dungeon ready to destroy Tristram.

Many adventurers tried to kill Diablo and find the treasure, like the brave knight Sirfreid or Odoacer the soldier but none of them came back...

# What is DevilutionX

DevilutionX is a port of Diablo and Hellfire that strives to make it simple to run the game while providing engine improvements, bugfixes, and some optional quality of life features.

Check out the [manual](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/wiki) for what features are available and how best to take advantage of them.

For a full list of changes see our [changelog](docs/CHANGELOG.md).

# How to Install

Note: You'll need access to the data from the original game. If you don't have an original CD then you can [buy Diablo from GoG.com](https://www.gog.com/game/diablo). Alternately you can use `spawn.mpq` from the [shareware](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionx-assets/releases/download/v2/spawn.mpq) [[2]](http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/demos/diablosw.exe) version, in place of `DIABDAT.MPQ`, to play the shareware portion of the game.

Download the latest [DevilutionX release](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/releases/latest) and extract the contents to a location of your choosing or [build from source](#building-from-source).

- Copy `DIABDAT.MPQ` from the CD or GOG-installation (or [extract it from the GoG installer](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/wiki/Extracting-the-.MPQs-from-the-GoG-installer)) to the DevilutionX folder.
- To run the Diablo: Hellfire expansion you will need to also copy `hellfire.mpq`, `hfmonk.mpq`, `hfmusic.mpq`, `hfvoice.mpq`.

For more detailed instructions: [Installation Instructions](./docs/installing.md).
